# python-flask-starter

A python Flask starter project for getting started with new projects quickly. There is currently
a single controller in a Flask blueprint with no tests.

### Goals
This project is evolving over times, but the goals are pretty stable:

1. Show how to integration test database queries and controllers.
2. Show how database migrations using yoyo work.
3. Show how Blueprints can encourage DDD practices.
